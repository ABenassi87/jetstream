## Adding your first org

After logging in to Jetstream for the first time, the first thing you need to do is connect Jetstream to one or more of your Salesforce orgs.

Jetstream uses OAuth2 for org connections, which means that Jetstream never gains access directly to your password,

To add an org, click the <button class="button button--link">+ Add Org</button> button at the top of the page.

You will be asked to choose an org type, this determines which Salesforce login url you will be redirected

- **Production / Developer**
- **Sandbox**
- **Pre-release**
- **Custom Login URL**

You will be redirected to Salesforce to login, then will be redirected back to Jetstream and your org will be connected.
