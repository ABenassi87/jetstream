You can execute anonymous apex using Jetstream, just like you can in the developer console.

Enter in your apex and press Submit (or ctrl/cmd+enter) to execute the apex and see the results on the right-hand side of the page.

Changing the **log levels** will determine how much detail is returned in the log from Salesforce.

:::tip

Each time you execute, Jetstream will save it in your history so you can easily recall it and run the query again.

:::

You can easily search the results using hte built-in filter and can also toggle to show just the debug statements in your code.
