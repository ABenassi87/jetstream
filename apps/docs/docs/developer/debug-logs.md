The debug logs page allows you to subscribe to Salesforce debug logs and view the results. Each time you visit the page, Jetstream will subscribe you to logs for 30 minutes and will extend this if you are still active on the page after that time.

When you are active on this page, Jetstream will periodically check with Salesforce to see if there are any new debug logs available, and will show them.

You can click the refresh icon to check more frequently if you need to.
